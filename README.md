# Tech Interview
This Repository is a Technology knowledge base targated for preparing technical interviews

### System-Design-Interview


```System design is a very broad topic. Even a software engineer with many years of working experience at a top IT company may not be an expert on system design. If you want to become an expert, you need to read many books, articles, and solve real large scale system design problems.```

These are some quick links to prepare systematically for system desgin interview

### Microservices

* What are Microservices?

   The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.  (James Lewis and Martin Fowler )
   
 * Benifits
 
    1. Strong Module Boundaries: Microservices reinforce modular structure, which is particularly important for larger teams.

    2. Independent Deployment: Simple services are easier to deploy, and since they are autonomous, are less likely to cause    system failures when they go wrong.(more details :- https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#deployment)
    
    3.Technology Diversity: With microservices you can mix multiple languages, development frameworks and data-storage technologies.(more details :- https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#diversity)
    
 * Few Drawbacks
   
    1. Distribution: Distributed systems are harder to program, since remote calls are slow and are always at risk of failure.

    2. Eventual Consistency: Maintaining strong consistency is extremely difficult for a distributed system, which means everyone has to manage eventual consistency. (https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#consistency)
    
    3. Operational Complexity: You need a mature operations team to manage lots of services, which are being redeployed regularly.(https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#ops)
